# 3D Printing Information

## Included Files
- `Top Case.stl` - The top part of the enclosure
- `Bottom Case.stl` - The bottom part of the enclosure

## Printing Recommendations
### Material
- PLA works great for this project
- Use a color that Mom will love!

### Print Settings
- Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 15%
- Supports: Yes, for overhangs. I used standard ones and not tree support
- Print time: ~3-4 hours in total

## Assembly Tips
1. Test-fit the Arduino and components before final assembly
2. The top case should fit smoothly into the bottom case with a strong enough hold
3. If too tight or too lose try smoothing the edges oder using glue for the final assembly
4. The holes and dimensions are designed for Arduino Uno Rev3 and a specific breadboard size (random one i had at home)
